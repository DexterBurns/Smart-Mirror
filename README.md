# Smart-Mirror

This Project is a Smart-Mirror that gives the user date, time, weather, a calendar, clock and compliment.
Inspired by the open source Magic Mirror, this is an attempt at creating the Magic Mirror with Python.

Warning: GUI will be extremely basic, but the methods of obtaining API data and format of said data will be sufficient.
